Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, noisy. example, death metal high energy, Bach prelude scores low scale. Perceptual features contributing attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, general entropy. key estimated overall key track. Integers map pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, . key detected, value -1. loudness overall loudness track decibels (dB). Loudness values averaged across entire track useful comparing relative loudness tracks. Loudness quality sound primary psychological correlate physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range -60 0 dB. mode Mode indicates modality (major minor) track, type scale melodic content derived. Major represented 1 minor 0. speechiness Speechiness detects presence spoken words track. exclusively speech-like recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), closer 1.0 attribute value. Values 0.66 describe tracks probably made entirely spoken words. Values 0.33 0.66 describe tracks may contain music speech, either sections layered, including cases rap music. Values 0.33 likely represent music non-speech-like tracks. acousticness confidence measure 0.0 1.0 whether track acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence track acoustic. instrumentalness Predicts whether track contains vocals. \"Ooh\" \"aah\" sounds treated instrumental context. Rap spoken word tracks clearly \"vocal\". closer instrumentalness value 1.0, greater likelihood track contains vocal content. Values 0.5 intended represent instrumental tracks, confidence higher value approaches 1.0. liveness Detects presence audience recording. Higher liveness values represent increased probability track performed live. value 0.8 provides strong likelihood track live. valence measure 0.0 1.0 describing musical positiveness conveyed track. Tracks high valence sound positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), tracks low valence sound negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). tempo overall estimated tempo track beats per minute (BPM). musical terminology, tempo speed pace given piece derives directly average beat duration. duration_ms Duration song milliseconds","code":""},{"path":"/reference/spotify_songs.html","id":"source","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Source","title":"Data of 5000 songs from 6 main categories (EDM, Latin, Pop, R&B, Rap, & Rock). — spotify_songs","text":"https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/spotify_songs.csv","code":""}]
